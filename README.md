# WEB IMAGE GALLERY SLIDER
#### Video Demo: <URL HERE> 
#### Description: 
For my final project, I decided to design a slider for an image gallery on the web. For this, in addition to html, I have used css and javascript codes.

I used style.css in the css folder to style the page and i used my.js for my slider javascript.

Fortunately, this project works well and the images I have already placed in the images folder are displayed beautifully.

Surely, many website designers can use this slider for their website image gallery.
